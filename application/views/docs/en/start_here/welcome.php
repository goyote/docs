<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>This website has a silly name because apparently the old one had the strange side effect of "harming" people... somehow. Now that we've changed it, that shouldn't happen anymore, so Hooray!</p>

<p>Now, on to business. kowut is a warm place where the editor likes to spend his time talking about <a href="http://kohanaframework.org">Kohana</a>. If you find anything useful great, if not that's ok. Done, the intro is over. Go have fun.</p>

<p><strong>News:</strong></p>

	<li>Alright, big changes are coming! I've decided to fork the official userguide, and improve that. So all the content in this website will soon be moved to their respective official repos (or rather my forks.) Instead of wasting my time creating a bug on redmine for every typo I find, and subsequent pull requests, I've decided to keep this domain and simply host my own version of the userguide. If the Kohana project ever decides to pull any of my changes they may do so easily.</li>
	<li>A tutorial site is under the works. I'm currently writing the first tut, tuto number 0! Writing real world bite size tutorials will allow me to further test Kohana components so I can write better docs. Stay tuned.</li>
