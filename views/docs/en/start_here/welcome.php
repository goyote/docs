<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>This website has a silly name because apparently the old one had the strange side effect of "harming" people... somehow. Now that we've changed it, that shouldn't happen anymore, so Hooray!</p>

<p>Now, on to business. kowut is a warm place where the editor likes to spend his time talking about <a href="http://kohanaframework.org">Kohana</a>. If you find anything useful great, if not that's ok. Done, the intro is over. Go have fun.</p>
